# 🐔 Chicken Banana Game 🍌

This is a simple minesweeper inspired minigame built with React as part of an activity for my Applications and Systems Integration subject at Holy Angel University.

We we're given creative freedom to style the website in however way we wanted, so as an avid pokemon fan, I took some creative liberties.

To start, get a buddy to play with you and decide which of you will represent the chicken and the banana. Then, take turns choosing squares in the 6x6 grid. If you select the other person's symbol, you lose and they win. It's a game of chance!
